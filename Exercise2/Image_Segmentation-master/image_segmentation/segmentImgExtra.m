function idx = segmentImgExtra(I, k, weight)
% function idx = segmentImage(img)
% Returns the logical image containing the segment ids obtained from
%   segmenting the input image
%
% INPUTS
% I - The input image contining textured foreground objects to be segmented
%     out.
% k - The number of segments to compute (also the k-means parameter).
%
% OUTPUTS
% idx - The logical image (same dimensions as the input image) contining
%       the segment ids after segmentation. The maximum value of idx is k.

% 1. Create your bank of filters using the given alogrithm;
% 2. Compute the filter responses by convolving your input image with
%     each of the num_filters in the bank of filters F.
%     responses(:,:,i)=conv2(I,F(:,:,i),'same')
%     NOTE: we suggest to use 'same' instead of 'full' or 'valid'.
% 3. Remember to take the absolute value of the filter responses (no
%     negative values should be used).
% 4. Construct a matrix X of the points to be clustered, where
%     the rows of X = the total number of pixels in I (rows*cols); and
%     the columns of X = num_filters;
%     i.e. each pixel is transformed into a num_filters-dimensional
%     vector.
% 5. Run kmeans to cluster the pixel features into k clusters,
%     returning a vector IDX of labels.
% 6. Reshape IDX into an image with same dimensionality as I and return
%     the reshaped index image.
